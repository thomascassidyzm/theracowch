# IMAGINE – E: Explore – Safety Behaviours

## Understanding the Hidden Trap

---

### READ – What Are Safety Behaviours?

Safety behaviours are the subtle things we do to prevent feared outcomes or manage anxiety. Unlike complete avoidance (not going to the party at all), safety behaviours let us do the thing... but with protective measures in place.

**Common examples:**
- Going to social events but staying glued to your best friend
- Making phone calls but having a script written out first
- Going to the shops but wearing headphones to avoid interaction
- Attending meetings but sitting near the exit
- Dating but constantly seeking reassurance you're "doing it right"
- Checking your phone repeatedly to make sure no one's upset with you
- Having a drink before social situations to "take the edge off"
- Over-preparing for everything to prevent failure

### The Paradox

Safety behaviours feel helpful because anxiety drops temporarily. But here's what's really happening:

**The Safety Behaviour Trap:**
1. You do the safety behaviour
2. The feared outcome doesn't happen
3. You conclude: *"I'm only safe BECAUSE I did that behaviour"*
4. The behaviour is reinforced
5. Anxiety remains (or grows stronger)
6. You become dependent on the safety behaviour

**The truth:** The feared outcome probably wouldn't have happened anyway, but you never get to learn that.

### Why They're Different from Helpful Coping

**Safety behaviour (unhelpful):** Checking your phone 50 times to make sure your partner isn't upset with you
**Healthy coping (helpful):** Having one honest conversation: "I sometimes worry you're upset - can we agree you'll tell me directly if something's wrong?"

**Safety behaviour (unhelpful):** Only going places with a "safe person" beside you
**Healthy coping (helpful):** Gradually building confidence in going places alone, starting small

**The key difference:** Healthy coping builds capability and confidence. Safety behaviours prevent learning and maintain dependency.

## REFLECT – Your Safety Behaviour Patterns

### Exercise 1: Safety Behaviour Detective (10 minutes)

Think about a situation that regularly makes you anxious. Now ask yourself:

**1. What do I DO in that situation to manage my anxiety?**

Write down everything - even things that seem normal or reasonable.

**2. For each behaviour, ask:**
- Does this SOLVE the problem, or just make me feel temporarily safer?
- What am I afraid would happen if I didn't do this?
- Does this behaviour stop me from learning I could cope without it?
- Am I doing this MORE over time, not less?

**3. Identify the safety behaviours:**

Mark which items on your list are:
- ✅ Genuine problem-solving (addressing the actual issue)
- ⚠️ Safety behaviours (preventing you from learning you'd be OK)

### Common Safety Behaviours by Category

**Social situations:**
- Avoiding eye contact
- Always having an "exit strategy"
- Staying on the edge of groups
- Preparing exact scripts for conversations

- Wearing clothes/makeup to "blend in"

**Work/performance:**
- Extreme over-preparation
- Never volunteering ideas
- Checking work excessively before submitting
- Always deferring to others' opinions
- Working late to avoid being "caught out"
- Only taking on tasks you're 100% certain you can do

**Health anxiety:**
- Constant body checking
- Repeatedly googling symptoms
- Seeking medical reassurance frequently
- Avoiding health information (paradoxically)
- Always having medication "just in case"

**Relationships:**
- Testing your partner repeatedly
- Needing constant reassurance of love
- Never expressing needs to avoid conflict
- People-pleasing to prevent rejection
- Checking their phone/social media
- Always being "perfect" to keep them

**General anxiety:**

## TRY – Safety Behaviour Audit

🕐 15 minutes

**Part 1: Identify**

Choose ONE situation that causes you regular anxiety.

Write down:
1. The situation: _______________
2. What I'm afraid will happen: _______________
3. What I do to try to prevent it: _______________
4. How long I've been doing this: _______________

**Part 2: Assess the Cost**

For your main safety behaviour, reflect:

- Has it stopped the anxiety from returning? (Probably not)
- Does it restrict my life or relationships?
- Do I rely on it more now than I used to?
- What would I be able to do if I didn't need this anymore?
- What am I NOT learning while I keep doing this?

**Part 3: Reality Check**

Think back: Has the feared outcome EVER actually happened? (Be honest)

- Never happened → You've been protecting yourself from something unlikely
- Happened once or twice → You survived it (evidence you can cope!)
- Happens regularly → This isn't a safety behaviour, it's actually a real problem that needs genuine problem-solving

## READ – The Evidence That Sets You Free

The only way to discover you don't need a safety behaviour is to **test what happens without it**.

This is called **behavioural experiments** in CBT, and it's the gold standard for overcoming anxiety.

### The Scientific Process:

1. **Prediction:** "If I don't do my safety behaviour, X will happen"
2. **Experiment:** Reduce or drop the safety behaviour in a controlled way
3. **Observe:** What actually happened?
4. **Learn:** Update your understanding based on evidence, not fear

**Example:**

- **Prediction:** "If I don't check my phone every 10 minutes, my partner will get mad and I won't know until it's too late"
- **Experiment:** Check phone only 3 times during a 4-hour period
- **Observe:** Partner wasn't upset. Nothing bad happened. Felt anxious at first, then it settled.
- **Learn:** I can cope with uncertainty. My partner will tell me directly if something's wrong. My anxiety was lying to me.

## TRY – The Gradual Reduction Experiment

🕐 Ongoing (1-2 weeks)

**Important:** Don't go cold turkey on safety behaviours. Gradual reduction is more effective and sustainable.

### Step 1: Choose Your Target

Pick ONE safety behaviour to gradually reduce this week.

Write it here: _______________

### Step 2: Create Your Reduction Plan

**Current frequency:** How much/often do you do this now? _______________

**Week 1 goal:** Reduce by 25-30% (e.g., if checking phone 40 times/day, reduce to 28)

**Week 2 goal:** Reduce by another 25% from current

**What will you do instead?** (Replace with healthy coping):
_______________

### Step 3: Make Predictions

Before you start, write down:

**I predict that if I reduce this behaviour:**
- I will feel _______________ (emotion)
- This will happen _______________ (outcome)
- My anxiety will be ___/10

### Step 4: Run the Experiment

For one week, stick to your reduction goal.

**Daily log:**

| Day | Did I stick to reduction? | Anxiety level (0-10) | What actually happened? |
|-----|---------------------------|----------------------|-------------------------|
| Mon |                           |                      |                         |
| Tue |                           |                      |                         |
| Wed |                           |                      |                         |
| Thu |                           |                      |                         |
| Fri |                           |                      |                         |
| Sat |                           |                      |                         |
| Sun |                           |                      |                         |

### Step 5: Review the Evidence

At the end of the week:

- Did your predictions come true? (Usually not!)
- What did you learn about your ability to cope?
- How did anxiety change over the week? (Usually drops after day 2-3)
- What will you experiment with next?

## TRY – The Approach Ladder

🕐 20 minutes to create, then ongoing practice

When you want to tackle a bigger fear, build an **approach ladder** - a series of gradually challenging steps that remove safety behaviours one at a time.

### How to Build Your Ladder:

**1. Define the Goal**

What situation do you currently avoid or do with heavy safety behaviours?

Example: "Give a presentation at work without hiding/reading from notes"

**2. Rate Your Current Anxiety**

If you had to do this RIGHT NOW with NO safety behaviours: ___/10

**3. Break It Into 10 Steps**

Start with something that would cause 2-3/10 anxiety, build up to 9-10/10.

**Each step should:**
- Remove one safety behaviour OR
- Add one small challenge
- Feel doable with some courage

### Example Ladder – Social Confidence:

| Step | Challenge | Anxiety (predicted) |
|------|-----------|---------------------|
| 1 | Say hello to shopkeeper (with friend nearby as safety behaviour) | 2/10 |
| 2 | Say hello to shopkeeper (alone - removing safety behaviour) | 3/10 |
| 3 | Ask shopkeeper a question about a product | 4/10 |
| 4 | Make small talk with stranger while waiting (friend nearby) | 5/10 |
| 5 | Make small talk with stranger (alone) | 6/10 |
| 6 | Attend small social gathering (30 mins only - time limit as safety behaviour) | 7/10 |
| 7 | Attend small gathering (stay for 1 hour) | 7/10 |
| 8 | Attend gathering and talk to someone new | 8/10 |
| 9 | Attend party (no time limit, no exit strategy planned) | 9/10 |
| 10 | Host a small gathering yourself | 9/10 |

### Rules for Climbing:

1. **Start at Step 1** (not where you "should" be able to start)
2. **Repeat each step until anxiety drops by 50%** (might take 3-5 practices)
3. **Only move up when ready** (if step feels too big, add a middle step)
4. **Expect anxiety** (that's how your brain learns!)
5. **Celebrate every step** (you're rewiring your brain with evidence)

## TRY – The Cost-Benefit Analysis

🕐 10 minutes

Sometimes we hold onto safety behaviours because we're not fully aware of what they're costing us.

### For your main safety behaviour:

**Short-term benefits (why I do it):**
- _______________
- _______________
- _______________

**Long-term costs (how it limits me):**
- _______________
- _______________
- _______________

**If I let go of this behaviour, I would be able to:**
- _______________
- _______________
- _______________

**What I'm NOT learning while I keep this behaviour:**
- _______________
- _______________

**The person I want to become:**
- Does/doesn't do this behaviour?
- Lives with more freedom/less restriction?
- Trusts themselves to cope?

## READ – Common Fears About Dropping Safety Behaviours

### "But what if the bad thing DOES happen?"

Then you'll handle it. And you'll have evidence that you can cope. That's actually better than living in constant fear of maybe-possibly-it-might-happen.

Remember: Safety behaviours don't actually prevent bad things from happening. They just make you FEEL like you're preventing them.

### "What if my anxiety gets too high?"

Anxiety is uncomfortable but not dangerous. And here's the science: if you stay in the situation without the safety behaviour, anxiety WILL peak and then naturally come down. That's how you learn.

If you keep escaping or using safety behaviours, you never learn that anxiety drops on its own.

### "Some things ARE risky - shouldn't I be careful?"

Yes! The difference:

**Reasonable precaution:** Wearing a seatbelt, looking both ways before crossing, preparing for an important presentation

**Safety behaviour:** Checking your seatbelt 15 times, avoiding all roads, spending 20 hours preparing for a 5-minute presentation

Ask yourself: "Is this proportionate to the actual risk?" and "Does everyone else do this much?"

### "What if I fail without my safety behaviour?"

Maybe you will. And maybe you'll learn that failure isn't catastrophic. You'll survive it, learn from it, and try again.

Right now, your safety behaviour is preventing you from learning what you're actually capable of.

---

## GROW – Self-Compassion for Safety Behaviours

Remember: You developed these behaviours for good reasons. They were your brain's attempt to keep you safe.

**Compassionate self-talk:**
- "These behaviours made sense based on what I feared"
- "I'm ready to learn I can cope without them"
- "It's OK to feel anxious while I practice"
- "Every small step is rewiring my brain"
- "I'm building the courage muscle"

**What NOT to say:**
- "I'm so stupid for doing this"
- "I should be over this by now"
- "Everyone else can do this easily"
- "What's wrong with me?"

Change happens through curiosity and compassion, not criticism.

---

## READ – The Science of Unlearning

When you repeatedly face situations without safety behaviours and nothing bad happens, your brain learns through a process called **inhibitory learning**.

Your brain doesn't erase the fear memory, but it creates a new, stronger memory: "I did the thing without protection and I was OK."

Each time you practice:
- ✅ Strengthens the "I can cope" pathway
- ✅ Weakens the "I must do this to be safe" pathway
- ✅ Increases your window of tolerance for uncertainty
- ✅ Builds genuine confidence (not false safety)

This is why repeated practice is essential. One good experience isn't enough - you need multiple instances of evidence.

---

## SUMMARY – Key Learnings

✅ Safety behaviours maintain anxiety by preventing you from learning you can cope

✅ They feel protective but actually keep you trapped

✅ The only way to freedom is testing what happens without them

✅ Gradual reduction is more effective than going cold turkey

✅ Every experiment gives you evidence to update your beliefs

✅ Anxiety will spike temporarily, then naturally decrease

✅ Building courage is a practice, not a destination

✅ You can trust yourself to handle uncertainty

---

## CLOSING REFLECTION

**"Courage is not the absence of fear. It's feeling the fear and doing it anyway - without the safety net."**

Every time you choose to face uncertainty without a safety behaviour, you're proving to your brain that you're more capable than it thought.

That's not just managing anxiety - that's reclaiming your life.

## Quick Reference: Spotting Safety Behaviours

❓ **Ask yourself:**
- Am I doing this to genuinely solve a problem, or to feel less anxious?
- Would I still do this if I wasn't anxious?
- Does this behaviour stop me from learning I'd be OK?
- Am I relying on this more over time, not less?
- What would confident-me do differently?

If the answer points to anxiety-reduction rather than problem-solving, it's likely a safety behaviour worth examining.

## Additional Exercises for Chat/App Integration

### Micro-Exercise: Safety Behaviour Quick Check (2 minutes)

Right now, in this moment:
1. What situation am I in or about to face?
2. What's my automatic protective impulse?
3. What would happen if I did 20% less of that?

Choose the 20% reduction and try it. Notice what happens.

### Daily Practice: The Courage Log

Each evening, write:
- One moment today I used a safety behaviour
- One moment I chose courage instead
- What I learned about my ability to cope

---

### For Mandy's Chat Integration:

**Key phrases that signal safety behaviours:**
- "I only do X if..."
- "I need to have Y ready just in case..."
- "I can't do Z without..."
- "I always..." (rigid patterns)
- "I have to check/prepare/make sure..."
- "What if..." (followed by protective planning)

**Mandy's response framework:**
1. Validate the fear/anxiety
2. Gently label it: "That sounds like it might be a safety behaviour..."
3. Explain the trap
4. Offer a small experiment: "What if we tried reducing that by 25% this week?"
5. Support and track progress
