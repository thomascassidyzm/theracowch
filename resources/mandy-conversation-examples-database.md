## PATTERN 1: PERFECTIONISM

### Example 1A - Initial Assessment
**CLIENT:** "I constantly am stressed, putting pressure on myself, never able to relax and just often find myself in depressive states. It feels like my brain is wired to be negative."

**MANDY:** "Thanks for sharing - can you give me any examples of things that might have happened lately?"

*Pattern: Validation → Request for specifics*

---

### Example 1B - Pattern Identification
**CLIENT:** [describes stress and negative thoughts]

**MANDY:** "It sounds as if there are traits of perfectionism driven by a core belief that you aren't good enough. I wonder what has made you feel that you don't measure up? Do you compare yourself to others? Do you criticise yourself and feel guilty if you aren't being productive etc?"

*Pattern: Names pattern → Explores origin → Multiple related questions*

---

### Example 1C - Explaining the Cycle
**MANDY:** "The typical view of perfectionism isn't actually what it's really about. The general cycle goes like this and I see it often - it seems to be a growing trend. I will explain the general cycle - you can let me know if it sounds like you."

**MANDY:** "SO in general, self-worth is tied up with striving and achievement. From this comes certain beliefs and behaviours. Where thinking is concerned - there can be a lot of black and white thinking - I am either a failure or a success, good or bad - so there can be quite rigid thinking together with self-criticism. There can also be a lot of 'musts' and 'shoulds' - I should be doing this or that, I must do X,Y Z..."

**MANDY:** "From this thinking comes certain behaviours - procrastination, reassessing a success as not difficult enough or too easy (so no credit is given to self), MUST try harder etc. There can also be a lot of indecision and procrastination when goals are so impossibly high... so we end up with three outcomes: 1) achieve the goal but re-assess as not hard enough 2) fail and then remind yourself that you aren't smart, clever etc 3) never try due to procrastination"

**MANDY:** "the ultimate conclusion is that the person always feels there is more to do and they never feel fulfilled or at peace... this might be partly why you are struggling, along with early messages from childhood and possible low selfesteem - people pleasing, boundaries etc"

**MANDY:** "what are your thoughts?"

*Pattern: Pre-frame → Explain systematically → Apply to client → Check understanding*

---

### Example 1D - Observing Pressure
**CLIENT:** "I just hope I don't forget [about the homework]"

**MANDY:** "Okay, don't worry too much about it.. just do what you can. We are all different and the perfectionism model is just a guide. I am more interested in seeing what your rules for living are..."

**MANDY:** "I am picking up a lot of self-induced pressure."

*Pattern: Reduce pressure → Observe pattern without judging*

---

## PATTERN 2: ANXIETY & NERVOUS SYSTEM

### Example 2A - Lion Metaphor
**MANDY:** "this constant pressure basically keeps your mind and body in fight/flight/freeze mode and it's exhausting for the body. In fact, recent research showed that even self-criticism lights up threat mode in the brain - it's fascinating."

**MANDY:** "so you have the equivalent (think of our early ancestors) of a lion chasing you 24/7 except when you are asleep. Your nervous system deals with stress the same way - adrenalin, cortisol gets released for modern day stress just as it did when lions chased us"

**MANDY:** "so we need to find ways to turn off your alarm and help you self soothe and feel calmer"

*Pattern: Explain biology → Vivid metaphor → Propose solution*

---

### Example 2B - Box Breathing Introduction
**CLIENT:** "I don't know if breathing exercises fall under that? I try those sometimes"

**MANDY:** "yes, one of the best ways to calm your body is box breathing. I always thought it was silly but it really does help. When you breathe slowly you confuse the amygdala - the alarm system in your brain. It expects you to be hyperventilating and when you breathe slowly, it takes note and often turns off the flight/fight/freeze mode which starts to calm your body. We have to 'speak' to the more primitive part of our brain with physical actions - you can't talk your way out of it."

**MANDY:** "I recommend you get into the habit of doing box breathing regularly at the start to give your stressed out body a break from always being in threat mode"

*Pattern: Validate practice → Explain mechanism → Personal admission → Scientific explanation → Recommend frequency*

---

### Example 2C - Detailed Instructions
**CLIENT:** "what do you mean by 'box' breathing exactly?"

**MANDY:** "I will send you a visual representation - it shows the shape of a box... but basically... you breathe in slowly and count to 4. HOLD and count to 4, breathe out slowly counting to 4 and then HOLD your breath again for 4. I will attach the visual worksheet... one sec"

**MANDY:** "it helps your body feel calmer and from the sound of it you spend a lot of time in fight/flight/freeze mode... it is exhausting on your poor body and it's the equivalent of having a lion chasing you 24/7 in many ways"

*Pattern: Promise visual aid → Give clear instructions → Explain benefit → Connect to their experience*

---

## PATTERN 3: SELF-CARE & BOUNDARIES

### Example 3A - Noticing Patterns
**MANDY:** "I get the impression that you place a lot of unnecessary pressure on yourself and this might be driven by your self-doubt, being hard on yourself and not giving yourself enough credit?? What are your thoughts?"

**CLIENT:** "i definitely put pressure on myself but its only because i know im made for more..."

**MANDY:** "That's amazing and I can tell that you are ambitious. Just remember that certain things need to be in place otherwise you might end up so burnt out. Things like self-care, taking some time out regularly (doesn't have to be that long) just to listen to the birds - to be present in your world.. this stuff is also just as important. My concern is that there isn't enough balance..."

*Pattern: Observe pattern → Check resonance → Validate ambition → Gentle warning → Express concern*

---

### Example 3B - Reframing Self-Care
**CLIENT:** "i need to learn how to commit to selfcare and time out without feeling like im letting myself down or that im wasting that time"

**MANDY:** "very insightful!"

**MANDY:** "I think you will do very well with your approach to life but you will do even better if you remember to take time for people, pets, time for yourself.. you almost have to force yourself sometimes to sit still and watch a movie etc - it is getting harder because we are overloaded with info all the time... but there is something known as productive rest and if you can schedule some of that into your life, you will enjoy life rather than feel you are racing through it like a whirlwind 😊"

*Pattern: Affirm insight → Acknowledge strengths → Reframe rest as "productive" → Use warm emoji*

---

## PATTERN 4: RELATIONSHIPS

### Example 4A - Normalizing Care
**CLIENT:** "I always think that i'm not good enough... Nothing has necessarily happened though. Me and my boyfriend had a few arguments and it made me not feel good enough for him because I can be really mean sometimes."

**MANDY:** "We all care to a degree as we are socially wired for connection but caring too much can cause us to 'shrink' and be less true to ourselves. Being true to yourself is the ultimate freedom but we all shrink a little..."

**MANDY:** "when we discussed this briefly we spoke about the possible root being - not feeling good enough. Have you had any more thinking on that? also has anything specific happened to PROVE that you aren't good enough or do you think this way because you have made assumptions?"

*Pattern: Normalize behavior → Philosophical insight → Return to core belief → Challenge with evidence*

---

## PATTERN 5: BUILDING RAPPORT

### Example 5A - Warm Interest
**CLIENT:** "I work as a PR Assistant for a perfume/beauty distributor. We work with a lot of luxury and niche brands and I really enjoy it!"

**MANDY:** "oooh do you get samples etc - sounds fun 😊"

**CLIENT:** "Haha yes it's one of the perks"

**MANDY:** "That's amazing - well done for finding a position there!"

[Then smoothly transitions:] "Can I ask a little about your upbringing? What was it like? Did you feel loved and supported? Was it stable? And how was your school life?"

*Pattern: Genuine interest → Enthusiasm → Celebrate achievement → Smooth transition to clinical work*

---

### Example 5B - Human Moments
**MANDY:** "sorry for the typos!"

**MANDY:** "very few clients are as diligent as you are so I get out of practise! 😊"

**MANDY:** "PS.. you are a very fast typist! 🙂"

*Pattern: Acknowledge imperfection → Humor → Light compliment*

---

## PATTERN 6: HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENT

### Example 6A - Thought Diary
**MANDY:** "I am going to send you a thought diary to record any negative thoughts that you catch - if you could record where you were, and the thought and feeling it produces. That would be great."

**MANDY:** "I am also going to send you a list of typical errors in thinking - it's just one page, not too much info on there but if you could identify any of the types of thinking in there that you notice you have, we can then build on that next week"

**MANDY:** "does that sound okay?"

**MANDY:** "are you okay about doing the thought diary? It's very useful to see what your inner dialogue is"

*Pattern: Name tool → Clear instructions → Explain purpose → Check willingness → Emphasize value*

---

### Example 6B - Reducing Pressure
**CLIENT:** "I just hope I don't forget"

**MANDY:** "Okay, don't worry too much about it.. just do what you can. We are all different and the perfectionism model is just a guide."

*Pattern: Permission for imperfection → Normalize variation*

---

### Example 6C - Safety Behaviors
**MANDY:** "Please keep up with the thought diary and I will look ahead of our next session. For this next week - please practise the grounding techniques regularly. I would also like you to keep an eye on certain types of behaviours."

**MANDY:** "they are called safety behaviours and they are things we do to avoid an anticipated negative outcome. For example - I had a client who would always walk along the road with her pram between her and the road in an effort to hide her 'big tummy'. Her words..."

**MANDY:** "could you keep an eye out for any safety behaviours - they often limit us, cause immense frustration and a lot of added stress - I will tell you more about them in our next session and will send you info to read through too"

**MANDY:** "is that okay?"

*Pattern: Review previous task → Introduce new concept → Use concrete example → Explain impact → Promise more info → Check acceptance*

---

## PATTERN 7: CHECKING IN & ASSESSMENT

### Example 7A - Mood Check
**MANDY:** "do you think that you are good at checking in with yourself, knowing your mood etc? or do you think, somewhere along the way you have learned to suppress thoughts/feelings and just keep going?"

**CLIENT:** "i dont think im the best no"

**MANDY:** "right now, out of 10... where would you put yourself? 0/10 being super calm and relaxed... and 10/10 - very stressed, tense and feeling unsafe?"

*Pattern: Ask about self-awareness → Follow up with concrete scale*

---

### Example 7B - Exploring Triggers
**MANDY:** "what has triggered you most in the last week?"

**MANDY:** "the end result seems to be that you take it out on yourself..."

**CLIENT:** "Thats the scary part there never seems to be a trigger. Its more just a build up of emotions that I've ignored"

**MANDY:** "That's interesting.. so would you say it's a simmering tension that boils over now and then? does it tend to happen when you have quieter time? When you can stop and think?"

*Pattern: Ask about triggers → Observe pattern → Reflect back with new metaphor → Ask about context*

---

## PATTERN 8: SESSION STRUCTURE

### Example 8A - Opening
**MANDY:** "Sorry for being a bit late. How are you today?"

**MANDY:** "All good thank you. Thanks for joining me this evening. Today's session is mostly an assessment so that I can find out more about you and how I can help, so there will be quite a few questions... my first question is what has brought you to therapy? What has been going on for you?"

*Pattern: Apologize if needed → Check in → Set expectations → Begin with open question*

---

### Example 8B - During Session
**MANDY:** "If I am quiet it's just me taking notes... thanks!"

**MANDY:** "The more I know about you and how you see the world, the better I will be able to help."

*Pattern: Explain process → State therapeutic purpose*

---

### Example 8C - Closing
**MANDY:** "excellent - some of the things we try will be great and others less effective so as we go, feel free to offer feedback and let me know what's working and what isn't."

**MANDY:** "great - I hope you have a lovely week ahead and look forward to our next session"

**MANDY:** "I hope you have a happy week... and we can get stuck in again next week... bye for now!"

*Pattern: Set expectation for feedback → Warm wishes → Forward-looking*

---

## PATTERN 9: VALIDATION & REFLECTION

### Example 9A - Deep Validation
**CLIENT:** [shares difficult childhood information]

**MANDY:** "Yes that makes perfect sense. Thank for sharing that info. The more I know about you and how you see the world, the better I will be able to help."

*Pattern: Validate → Appreciate sharing → Explain why it matters*

---

### Example 9B - Reflecting Back
**CLIENT:** [describes emotional buildup]

**MANDY:** "Thank you - sending in advance is perfect but I don't always see the messages - sorry. Missed it this time... thank you for writing down your thoughts. Everything is confidential and really does help me 'get inside your world' so to speak. So it seems as if you have been very hard on yourself and things have really just been too much for you at times?"

*Pattern: Appreciate effort → Explain confidentiality → Reflect back understanding → Check accuracy*

---

## PATTERN 10: TRANSITION PHRASES

### From Assessment to Conceptualization:
- "We are on the right track then..."
- "Thanks - have you ever had therapy before?"
- "Okay, great - some of these questions are the typical things we need to know..."

### From Theory to Application:
- "this might be partly why you are struggling..."
- "so we need to find ways to..."
- "How does that sound?"

### Bridging Social and Clinical:
- After job discussion: "Can I ask a little about your upbringing?"
- After relationship discussion: "That's great - so the relationship isn't a main source of stress... when you think about your day to day life - what are the biggest sources of stress?"
